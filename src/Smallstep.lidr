== Smallstep: Small-step Operational Semantics

The evaluators we have seen so far (for `aexp`s, `bexp`s,
commands, ...) have been formulated in a "big-step" style: they
specify how a given expression can be evaluated to its final
value (or a command plus a store to a final store) "all in one big
step."

This style is simple and natural for many purposes -- indeed,
Gilles Kahn, who popularized it, called it _natural semantics_.
But there are some things it does not do well.  In particular, it
does not give us a natural way of talking about _concurrent_
programming languages, where the semantics of a program -- i.e.,
the essence of how it behaves -- is not just which input states
get mapped to which output states, but also includes the
intermediate states that it passes through along the way, since
these states can also be observed by concurrently executing code.

Another shortcoming of the big-step style is more technical, but
critical in many situations.  Suppose we want to define a variant
of Imp where variables could hold _either_ numbers _or_ lists of
numbers.  In the syntax of this extended language, it will be
possible to write strange expressions like `2 + nil`, and our
semantics for arithmetic expressions will then need to say
something about how such expressions behave.  One possibility is
to maintain the convention that every arithmetic expressions
evaluates to some number by choosing some way of viewing a list as
a number -- e.g., by specifying that a list should be interpreted
as `0` when it occurs in a context expecting a number.  But this
is really a bit of a hack.

A much more natural approach is simply to say that the behavior of
an expression like `2+nil` is _undefined_ -- i.e., it doesn't
evaluate to any result at all.  And we can easily do this: we just
have to formulate `aeval` and `beval` as `Inductive` propositions
rather than Fixpoints, so that we can make them partial functions
instead of total ones.

Now, however, we encounter a serious deficiency.  In this
language, a command might fail to map a given starting state to
any ending state for _two quite different reasons_: either because
the execution gets into an infinite loop or because, at some
point, the program tries to do an operation that makes no sense,
such as adding a number to a list, so that none of the evaluation
rules can be applied.

These two outcomes -- nontermination vs. getting stuck in an
erroneous configuration -- should not be confused.  In particular, we
want to _allow_ the first (permitting the possibility of infinite
loops is the price we pay for the convenience of programming with
general looping constructs like `while`) but _prevent_ the
second (which is just wrong), for example by adding some form of
_typechecking_ to the language.  Indeed, this will be a major
topic for the rest of the course.  As a first step, we need a way
of presenting the semantics that allows us to distinguish
nontermination from erroneous "stuck states."

So, for lots of reasons, we'd often like to have a finer-grained
way of defining and reasoning about program behaviors.  This is
the topic of the present chapter.  Our goal is to replace the
"big-step" `eval` relation with a "small-step" relation that
specifies, for a given program, how the "atomic steps" of
computation are performed.

== A Toy Language

To save space in the discussion, let's go back to an
incredibly simple language containing just constants and
addition.  (We use single letters -- `C` and `P` (for Constant and
Plus) -- as constructor names, for brevity.)  At the end of the
chapter, we'll see how to apply the same techniques to the full
Imp language.

> data Tm : Type where
>   C : Nat -> Tm         -- Constant
>   P : Tm -> Tm -> Tm    -- Plus

Here is a standard evaluator for this language, written in
    the big-step style that we've been using up to this point.

> evalF : (t : Tm) -> Nat
> evalF (C n) = n
> evalF (P a1 a2) = evalF a1 + evalF a2

Here is the same evaluator, written in exactly the same
    style, but formulated as an inductively defined relation.  Again,
    we use the notation `t >>> n` for "`t` evaluates to `n`."

\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \infer0[\idr{E_Const}]{\idr{C n >>> n}}
  \end{prooftree}
  \newline
\]

\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{\idr{t1 >>> n1}}
    \hypo{\idr{t1 >>> n2}}
    \infer2[\idr{E_Plus}]{\idr{P t1 t2 >>> n1 + n2}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

> infixl 6 >>>

> mutual
>   (>>>) : Tm -> Nat -> Type
>   (>>>) = Eval
>
>   data Eval : Tm -> Nat -> Type where
>     E_Const : C n >>> n
>     E_Plus  : t1 >>> n1 -> t2 >>> n2 -> P t1 t2 >>> n1 + n2
>


Now, here is the corresponding _small-step_ evaluation relation.

\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \infer0[\idr{ST_PlusConstConst'}]{\idr{P (C n1) (C n2) ->> C (n1 + n2)}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{\idr{t1 ->> t1'}}
    \infer1[\idr{ST_Plus1'}]{\idr{P t1 t2 ->> P t1' t2}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{\idr{t2 ->> t2'}}
    \infer1[\idr{ST_Plus2'}]{\idr{P (C n1) t2 ->> P (C n1) t2'}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

> mutual
>   infixl 6 ->>
>   (->>) : Tm -> Tm -> Type
>   (->>) = Step'
>
>   data Step' : Tm -> Tm -> Type where
>     ST_PlusConstConst' : P (C n1) (C n2) ->> C (n1 + n2)
>     ST_Plus1' : t1 ->> t1' -> P t1 t2 ->> P t1' t2
>     ST_Plus2' : t2 ->> t2' -> P (C n1) t2 ->> P (C n1) t2'
>

Things to notice:

- We are defining just a single reduction step, in which
  one `P` node is replaced by its value.

- Each step finds the _leftmost_ `P` node that is ready to
  go (both of its operands are constants) and rewrites it in
  place.  The first rule tells how to rewrite this `P` node
  itself; the other two rules tell how to find it.

- A term that is just a constant cannot take a step.

Let's pause and check a couple of examples of reasoning with
    the `step` relation...

If `t1` can take a step to `t1'`, then `P t1 t2` steps
    to `P t1' t2`:

>   test_step_1 :
>      P
>        (P (C 0) (C 3))
>        (P (C 2) (C 4))
>      ->>
>      P
>        (C (0 + 3))
>        (P (C 2) (C 4))
>   test_step_1  = ST_Plus1' ST_PlusConstConst'


==== Exercise: 1 star (test_step_2)
Right-hand sides of sums can take a step only when the
    left-hand side is finished: if `t2` can take a step to `t2'`,
    then `P (C n) t2` steps to `P (C n) t2'`:

>   test_step_2 :
>      P
>        (C 0)
>        (P
>          (C 2)
>          (P (C 0) (C 3)))
>      ->>
>      P
>        (C 0)
>        (P
>          (C 2)
>          (C (0 + 3)))
>   test_step_2 = ?test_step_2_rhs

== Relations

We will be working with several different single-step relations,
    so it is helpful to generalize a bit and state a few definitions
    and theorems about relations in general.  (The optional chapter
    `Rel.lidr` develops some of these ideas in a bit more detail; it may
    be useful if the treatment here is too dense.

A _binary relation_ on a set `X` is a family of propositions
parameterized by two elements of `X` -- i.e., a proposition about
pairs of elements of `X`.

> Relation : Type -> Type
> Relation t = t -> t -> Type

Our main examples of such relations in this chapter will be
    the single-step reduction relation, `->>`, and its multi-step
    variant, `->>*` (defined below), but there are many other
    examples -- e.g., the "equals," "less than," "less than or equal
    to," and "is the square of" relations on numbers, and the "prefix
    of" relation on lists and strings.

One simple property of the `->>` relation is that, like the
    big-step evaluation relation for Imp, it is _deterministic_.

_Theorem_: For each `t`, there is at most one `t'` such that `t`
steps to `t'` (`t ->> t'` is provable).  This is the
same as saying that `->>` is deterministic.

_Proof sketch_: We show that if `x` steps to both `y1` and
    `y2`, then `y1` and `y2` are equal, by induction on a derivation
    of `step x y1`.  There are several cases to consider, depending on
    the last rule used in this derivation and the last rule in the
    given derivation of `step x y2`.

- If both are `ST_PlusConstConst'`, the result is immediate.

- The cases when both derivations end with `ST_Plus1` or
  `ST_Plus2` follow by the induction hypothesis.

- It cannot happen that one is `ST_PlusConstConst'` and the other
  is `ST_Plus1` or `ST_Plus2'`, since this would imply that `x`
  has the form `P t1 t2` where both `t1` and `t2` are
  constants (by `ST_PlusConstConst'`) _and_ one of `t1` or `t2`
  has the form `P _`.

- Similarly, it cannot happen that one is `ST_Plus1'` and the
  other is `ST_Plus2'`, since this would imply that `x` has the
  form `P t1 t2` where `t1` has both the form `P t11 t12` and the
  form `C n`.

Formally:


> deterministic : {xt: Type} -> {x: xt} -> {y1: xt} -> {y2: xt} -> (r: Relation xt) -> Type
> deterministic {xt} {x} {y1} {y2} r =  r x y1 -> r x y2 -> y1 = y2


> step_deterministic : deterministic Step'
> step_deterministic ST_PlusConstConst' hyp =
>   case hyp of
>     ST_PlusConstConst' => Refl
>     ST_Plus1' _ impossible
>     ST_Plus2' _ impossible
> step_deterministic (ST_Plus1' l) hyp =
>   case hyp of
>     ST_PlusConstConst' impossible
>     ST_Plus1' l' => rewrite step_deterministic l l' in Refl
>     ST_Plus2' _ impossible
> step_deterministic (ST_Plus2' r) hyp =
>   case hyp of
>     ST_PlusConstConst' impossible
>     ST_Plus1' _ impossible
>     ST_Plus2' r' => rewrite step_deterministic r r' in Refl


=== Values

Next, it will be useful to slightly reformulate the
    definition of single-step reduction by stating it in terms of
    "values."

It is useful to think of the `->>` relation as defining an
    _abstract machine_:

- At any moment, the _state_ of the machine is a term.

- A _step_ of the machine is an atomic unit of computation --
  here, a single "add" operation.

- The _halting states_ of the machine are ones where there is no
  more computation to be done. *)

We can then execute a term `t` as follows:

- Take `t` as the starting state of the machine.

- Repeatedly use the `->>` relation to find a sequence of
  machine states, starting with `t`, where each state steps to
  the next.

- When no more reduction is possible, "read out" the final state
  of the machine as the result of execution.

Intuitively, it is clear that the final states of the
    machine are always terms of the form `C n` for some `n`.
    We call such terms _values_.

> data Value : Tm -> Type where
>   V_const : (n : Nat) -> Value (C n)
>

Having introduced the idea of values, we can use it in the
    definition of the `>>-` relation to write `ST_Plus2` rule in a
    slightly more elegant way:


\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \infer0[\idr{ST_PlusConstConst}]{\idr{P (C n1) (C n2) >>- C (n1 + n2)}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{\idr{t1 >>- t1'}}
    \infer1[\idr{ST_Plus1}]{\idr{P t1 t2 >>- P t1' t2}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

\[
  \begin{prooftree}
  \hypo{\idr{value v1}}
    \hypo{\idr{t2 >>- t2'}}
    \infer2[\idr{ST_Plus2}]{\idr{P v1 t2 >>- P v1 t2'}}
  \end{prooftree}
\]

Again, the variable names here carry important information:
    by convention, `v1` ranges only over values, while `t1` and `t2`
    range over arbitrary terms.  (Given this convention, the explicit
    `value` hypothesis is arguably redundant.  We'll keep it for now,
    to maintain a close correspondence between the informal and Coq
    versions of the rules, but later on we'll drop it in informal
    rules for brevity.)

Here are the formal rules:

> mutual
>   infixl 6 >>-
>   (>>-) : Tm -> Tm -> Type
>   (>>-) = Step
>
>   data Step : Tm -> Tm -> Type where
>     ST_PlusConstConst : P (C n1) (C n2) >>- C (n1 + n2)
>     ST_Plus1 : t1 >>- t1' -> P t1 t2 >>- P t1' t2
>     ST_Plus2 : Value v1 -> t2 >>- t2' -> P v1 t2 >>- P v1 t2'

==== Exercise: 3 stars, recommended (redo_determinism)

As a sanity check on this change, let's re-verify determinism.

_Proof sketch_: We must show that if `x` steps to both `y1` and
`y2`, then `y1` and `y2` are equal.  Consider the final rules used
in the derivations of `step x y1` and `step x y2`.

- If both are `ST_PlusConstConst`, the result is immediate.

- It cannot happen that one is `ST_PlusConstConst` and the other
  is `ST_Plus1` or `ST_Plus2`, since this would imply that `x` has
  the form `P t1 t2` where both `t1` and `t2` are constants (by
  `ST_PlusConstConst`) _and_ one of `t1` or `t2` has the form `P _`.

- Similarly, it cannot happen that one is `ST_Plus1` and the other
  is `ST_Plus2`, since this would imply that `x` has the form `P
  t1 t2` where `t1` both has the form `P t11 t12` and is a
  value (hence has the form `C n`).

- The cases when both derivations end with `ST_Plus1` or
  `ST_Plus2` follow by the induction hypothesis.

Most of this proof is the same as the one above.  But to get
    maximum benefit from the exercise you should try to write your
    formal version from scratch and just use the earlier one if you
    get stuck.

=== Strong Progress and Normal Forms

The definition of single-step reduction for our toy language
    is fairly simple, but for a larger language it would be easy to
    forget one of the rules and accidentally create a situation where
    some term cannot take a step even though it has not been
    completely reduced to a value.  The following theorem shows that
    we did not, in fact, make such a mistake here.

_Theorem_ (_Strong Progress_): If `t` is a term, then either `t`
    is a value or else there exists a term `t'` such that `t >>- t'`.

_Proof_: By induction on `t`.

- Suppose `t = C n`. Then `t` is a value.

- Suppose `t = P t1 t2`, where (by the IH) `t1` either is a value
  or can step to some `t1'`, and where `t2` is either a value or
  can step to some `t2'`. We must show `P t1 t2` is either a value
  or steps to some `t'`.

  - If `t1` and `t2` are both values, then `t` can take a step, by
    `ST_PlusConstConst`.

  - If `t1` is a value and `t2` can take a step, then so can `t`,
    by `ST_Plus2`.

  - If `t1` can take a step, then so can `t`, by `ST_Plus1`.

Or, formally:

> strong_progress : (t: Tm) -> Either (Value t) (t': Tm ** Step t t')

> strong_progress (C n) = Left (V_const n)
> strong_progress (P (C n) r) = Right $
>    case r of
>       (C n')    =>  (C (n + n') ** ST_PlusConstConst)
>       (P l' r') =>  case strong_progress (P l' r') of
>                           Right (r ** prf1) => (P (C n) r ** ST_Plus2 (V_const n) prf1)
>                           Left (V_const (P l r)) impossible
> strong_progress (P (P l' r') r) = Right $
>     case strong_progress (P l' r') of
>       Right (l ** prf1) => (P l r  ** ST_Plus1 prf1)
>       Left (V_const (P l r)) impossible

This important property is called _strong progress_, because
    every term either is a value or can "make progress" by stepping to
    some other term.  (The qualifier "strong" distinguishes it from a
    more refined version that we'll see in later chapters, called
    just _progress_.)

The idea of "making progress" can be extended to tell us something
    interesting about values: in this language, values are exactly the
    terms that _cannot_ make progress in this sense.

To state this observation formally, let's begin by giving a name
    to terms that cannot make progress.  We'll call them _normal
    forms_.

> normal_form : {X:Type} -> Relation X -> X -> Type
> normal_form r t = Not (t' ** r t t')

Note that this definition specifies what it is to be a normal form
    for an _arbitrary_ relation `R` over an arbitrary set `X`, not
    just for the particular single-step reduction relation over terms
    that we are interested in at the moment.  We'll re-use the same
    terminology for talking about other relations later in the
    course.

We can use this terminology to generalize the observation we made
    in the strong progress theorem: in this language, normal forms and
    values are actually the same thing.

> value_is_nf : (v : Tm) -> Value v -> normal_form Step v
> value_is_nf (C n) prf = notStepCN
>   where notStepCN: (t' : Tm ** Step (C n) t') -> Void
>         notStepCN (t' ** c) impossible
> value_is_nf (P l r) prf = void (notValueP prf)
>   where notValueP: Not (Value (P l r))
>         notValueP (V_const _) impossible

> nf_is_value : (v : Tm) -> normal_form Step v -> Value v
> nf_is_value (C n) prf = V_const n
> nf_is_value (P l r) prf =
>   case strong_progress (P l r) of
>     Left va => va
>     Right pa => void (prf pa)

> iff : {p,q : Type} -> Type
> iff {p} {q} = (p -> q, q -> p)

> syntax [p] "<->" [q] = iff {p} {q}

> nf_same_as_value : (normal_form Step t) <-> (Value t)
> nf_same_as_value {t} = (nf_is_value t,value_is_nf t)

Why is this interesting?

Because `value` is a syntactic concept -- it is defined by looking
at the form of a term -- while `normal_form` is a semantic one --
it is defined by looking at how the term steps.  It is not obvious
that these concepts should coincide!

Indeed, we could easily have written the definitions so that they
    would _not_ coincide.

==== Exercise: 3 stars, optional (value_not_same_as_normal_form1)

We might, for example, mistakenly define `value` so that it
    includes some terms that are not finished reducing.

(Even if you don't work this exercise and the following ones
    in Idris, make sure you can think of an example of such a term.)


> data Value' : Tm -> Type where
>   V_const' : {n: Nat} -> Value' (C n)
>   V_funny : {t1: Tm} -> {n2: Nat} -> Value' (P t1 (C n2))

> value_not_same_as_normal_form : (v : Tm ** (Value' v, Not (normal_form Step'' v)))
> value_not_same_as_normal_form = ?value_not_same_as_normal_form_rhs

==== Exercise: 2 stars, optional (value_not_same_as_normal_form2)

Alternatively, we might mistakenly define `step` so that it
    permits something designated as a value to reduce further.

> mutual
>   infixl 6 ->>>-
>   (->>>-) : Tm -> Tm -> Type
>   (->>>-) = Step'''
>
>   data Step''' : Tm -> Tm -> Type where
>     ST_Funny : C n ->>>- P (C n) (C 0)
>     ST_PlusConstConst''' : P (C n1) (C n2) ->>>- C (n1 + n2)
>     ST_Plus1''' :
>       t1 ->>>- t1' ->
>       P t1 t2 ->>>- P t1' t2
>     ST_Plus2''' :
>       Value' v1 ->
>       t2 ->>>- t2' ->
>       P v1 t2 ->>>- P v1 t2'

> value_not_same_as_normal_form''' : (v : Tm ** (Value v, Not (normal_form Step''' v)))
> value_not_same_as_normal_form''' = ?value_not_same_as_normal_form_rhs'''

==== Exercise: 3 stars, optional (value_not_same_as_normal_form3)

Finally, we might define `value` and `step` so that there is some
    term that is not a value but that cannot take a step in the `step`
    relation.  Such terms are said to be _stuck_. In this case this is
    caused by a mistake in the semantics, but we will also see
    situations where, even in a correct language definition, it makes
    sense to allow some terms to be stuck.

> mutual
>   infixl 6 ->>-
>   (->>-) : Tm -> Tm -> Type
>   (->>-) = Step''''
>
>   data Step'''' : Tm -> Tm -> Type where
>     ST_PlusConstConst'''' : P (C n1) (C n2) ->>- C (n1 + n2)
>     ST_Plus1'''' :
>       t1 ->>- t1' ->
>       P t1 t2 ->>- P t1' t2

(Note that `ST_Plus2` is missing.)

> value_not_same_as_normal_form'''' : (t : Tm ** (Not (Value t), normal_form Step'''' t))
> value_not_same_as_normal_form'''' = ?value_not_same_as_normal_form_rhs''''


=== Additional Exercises

Here is another very simple language whose terms, instead of being
    just addition expressions and numbers, are just the booleans true
    and false and a conditional expression...

==== Exercise: 3 stars, optional (progress_bool)

Just as we proved a progress theorem for plus expressions, we can
    do so for boolean expressions, as well.

==== Exercise: 2 stars (smallstep_bool_shortcut)

Suppose we want to add a "short circuit" to the step relation for
    boolean expressions, so that it can recognize when the `then` and
    `else` branches of a conditional are the same value (either
    `ttrue` or `tfalse`) and reduce the whole conditional to this
    value in a single step, even if the guard has not yet been reduced
    to a value. For example, we would like this proposition to be
    provable:

```idris
     tif
        (tif ttrue ttrue ttrue)
        tfalse
        tfalse
 ->>
     tfalse.
```

Write an extra clause for the step relation that achieves this
    effect and prove `bool_step_prop4`.

     your answer.

== Multi-Step Reduction

We've been working so far with the _single-step reduction_
relation `->>`, which formalizes the individual steps of an
abstract machine for executing programs.

We can use the same machine to reduce programs to completion -- to
find out what final result they yield.  This can be formalized as
follows:

- First, we define a _multi-step reduction relation_ `->>*`, which
  relates terms `t` and `t'` if `t` can reach `t'` by any number
  (including zero) of single reduction steps.

- Then we define a "result" of a term `t` as a normal form that
  `t` can reach by multi-step reduction.

Since we'll want to reuse the idea of multi-step reduction many
times, let's take a little extra trouble and define it
generically.

Given a relation `R`, we define a relation `multi R`, called the
multi-step closure of `R`_ as follows.

> mutual
>   infixl 6 ->>*
>   (->>*) : Tm -> Tm -> Type
>   (->>*) t t' = Multi Step t t'
>
>   data Multi: {X: Type} -> (R: Relation X) -> Relation X where
>     Multi_refl  : {X: Type} -> {R: Relation X} -> {x : X} ->  Multi R x x
>     Multi_step  : {X: Type} -> {R: Relation X} -> {x, y, z : X} ->
>                       R x y -> Multi R y z -> Multi R x z

(In the `Rel` chapter of _Logical Foundations_ this relation is called
`clos_refl_trans_1n`.  We give it a shorter name here for the sake
of readability.)

The effect of this definition is that `multi R` relates two
elements `x` and `y` if

- `x = y`, or
- `R x y`, or
- there is some nonempty sequence `z1`, `z2`, ..., `zn` such that

   R x z1
   R z1 z2
   ...
   R zn y.

Thus, if `R` describes a single-step of computation, then `z1`...`zn`
is the sequence of intermediate steps of computation between `x` and
`y`.

We write `->>*` for the `multi step` relation on terms.

The relation `multi R` has several crucial properties.

First, it is obviously _reflexive_ (that is, `forall x, multi R x
x`).  In the case of the `->>*` (i.e., `multi step`) relation, the
intuition is that a term can execute to itself by taking zero
steps of execution.

Second, it contains `R` -- that is, single-step executions are a
particular case of multi-step executions.  (It is this fact that
justifies the word "closure" in the term "multi-step closure of
`R`.")


> multi_R : {X: Type} -> {R: Relation X} -> (x,y: X) -> R x y -> (Multi R) x y
> multi_R x y h = Multi_step h (Multi_refl)

Third, `multi R` is _transitive_.

> multi_trans: {X:Type} -> {R: Relation X} -> {x, y, z : X} ->
>   Multi R x y  -> Multi R y z -> Multi R x z
> multi_trans m1 m2 =
>    case m1 of
>      Multi_refl => m2
>      Multi_step r mx =>
>         let indHyp = multi_trans mx m2
>         in Multi_step r indHyp

In particular, for the `multi step` relation on terms, if
    `t1->>*t2` and `t2->>*t3`, then `t1->>*t3`.

=== Examples

Here's a specific instance of the `multi step` relation:

> test_multistep_1:
>      P
>        (P (C 0) (C 3))
>        (P (C 2) (C 4))

> test_multistep_1 =

>   in Multi_step {z=z} (ST_Plus1 ST_PlusConstConst)
>       (Multi_step {z=z} (ST_Plus2 (V_const 3) ST_PlusConstConst)
>         (Multi_step ST_PlusConstConst Multi_refl))

>      P (C 0) (C 3)

>      P
>        (C 0)
>        (C (2 + (0 + 3)))
> test_multistep_4 = ?test_multistep_4_rhs

=== Normal Forms Again

If `t` reduces to `t'` in zero or more steps and `t'` is a
    normal form, we say that "`t'` is a normal form of `t`."

> step_normal_form : (t : Tm) -> Type
> step_normal_form = normal_form Step

> normal_form_of : Tm -> Tm -> Type
> normal_form_of t t' = (t ->>* t', step_normal_form t')

We have already seen that, for our language, single-step reduction is
    deterministic -- i.e., a given term can take a single step in
    at most one way.  It follows from this that, if `t` can reach
    a normal form, then this normal form is unique.  In other words, we
    can actually pronounce `normal_form t t'` as "`t'` is _the_
    normal form of `t`."

Indeed, something stronger is true for this language (though not
    for all languages): the reduction of _any_ term `t` will
    eventually reach a normal form -- i.e., `normal_form_of` is a
    _total_ function.  Formally, we say the `step` relation is
    _normalizing_.

> normalizing : {x: Type} -> (r: Relation x) -> Type
> normalizing {x} {r} = (t: x) -> (t' : x ** (Multi r t t', normal_form r t'))

To prove that `step` is normalizing, we need a couple of lemmas.

First, we observe that, if `t` reduces to `t'` in many steps, then
the same sequence of reduction steps within `t` is also possible
when `t` appears as the left-hand child of a `P` node, and
similarly when `t` appears as the right-hand child of a `P`
node whose left-hand child is a value.

> multistep_congr_1 : (t1 ->>* t1') -> ((P t1 t2) ->>* P t1' t2)
> multistep_congr_1 mult =
>   case mult of
>     Multi_refl => Multi_refl
>     Multi_step step mult' =>

> multistep_congr_2 {v=V_const i} mult = ?multistep_congr_2_rhs

With these lemmas in hand, the main proof is a straightforward
    induction.

_Theorem_: The `step` function is normalizing -- i.e., for every
    `t` there exists some `t'` such that `t` steps to `t'` and `t'` is
    a normal form.

_Proof sketch_: By induction on terms.  There are two cases to
    consider:

- `t = C n` for some `n`.  Here `t` doesn't take a step, and we
  have `t' = t`.  We can derive the left-hand side by reflexivity
  and the right-hand side by observing (a) that values are normal
  forms (by `nf_same_as_value`) and (b) that `t` is a value (by
  `v_const`).

- `t = P t1 t2` for some `t1` and `t2`.  By the IH, `t1` and `t2`
  have normal forms `t1'` and `t2'`.  Recall that normal forms are
  values (by `nf_same_as_value`); we know that `t1' = C n1` and
  `t2' = C n2`, for some `n1` and `n2`.  We can combine the `->>*`
  derivations for `t1` and `t2` using `multi_congr_1` and
  `multi_congr_2` to prove that `P t1 t2` reduces in many steps to
  `C (n1 + n2)`.

  It is clear that our choice of `t' = C (n1 + n2)` is a value,
  which is in turn a normal form. `` *)

(** The key ideas in the proof can be seen in the following picture:

       C (n1 + n2)

    That is, the multistep reduction of a term of the form [P t1 t2]
    proceeds in three phases:
       - First, we use [ST_Plus1] some number of times to reduce [t1]
         to a normal form, which must (by [nf_same_as_value]) be a
         term of the form [C n1] for some [n1].
       - Next, we use [ST_Plus2] some number of times to reduce [t2]

         n2] for some [n2].

(** The semantics of commands is the interesting part.  We need two
    small tricks to make it work:

       - We use [SKIP] as a "command value" -- i.e., a command that
         has reached a normal form.

            - An assignment command reduces to [SKIP] (and an updated
              state).

            - The sequencing command waits until its left-hand
              subcommand has reduced to [SKIP], then throws it away so
              that reduction can continue with the right-hand
              subcommand.

       - We reduce a [WHILE] command by transforming it into a
         conditional followed by the same [WHILE]. *)

(** (There are other ways of achieving the effect of the latter
    trick, but they all share the feature that the original [WHILE]
    command needs to be saved somewhere while a single copy of the loop
    body is being reduced.) *)
